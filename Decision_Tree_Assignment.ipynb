        "Answer: A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that helps us make decisions by splitting data into branches based on features. In classification, it works by dividing the dataset into smaller subsets using conditions until we reach leaf nodes that represent class labels. We can think of it as asking a series of yes/no questions that guide us toward the correct category."

        "\n",
        "Answer: Gini Impurity and Entropy are measures used to check how mixed the classes are in a dataset. Gini measures the probability of misclassifying an item, while Entropy measures the amount of randomness or disorder in the data. When building a Decision Tree, we aim for splits that reduce impurity the most, so these measures guide us in choosing the best feature to split on."

        "\n",
        "Answer: Pre-pruning means we stop the tree from growing too deep by setting limits like maximum depth or minimum samples per split, which helps us avoid overfitting early. Post-pruning, on the other hand, lets the tree grow fully and then trims back unnecessary branches to simplify it. A key advantage of pre-pruning is saving time and computation, while post-pruning often gives us a more accurate and generalized model."

        "Answer: Information Gain measures how much uncertainty or impurity is reduced when we split the data using a particular feature. It compares the entropy before the split and after the split, and the higher the gain, the better the feature is at separating the classes. It is important because it helps us choose the most informative feature, leading to a more accurate and efficient Decision Tree."

However, they can easily overfit the data and may not perform well when the dataset is very large or noisy unless we use techniques like pruning."
